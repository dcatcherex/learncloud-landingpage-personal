        "Note": "Candy-Selling Youth Finds Wallet \nTHURMONT (April 22)-0n Tuesday a \nwallet containing a sizable amount of money \nwas discovered in Thurmont by 13-year-old \nTim Suderman. That morning, Tim was out \nselling candy bars door-to-door to earn \nmoney for the new uniforms needed by his \nmiddle school football team. \"I was on the \nsidewalk along Fount Street when I noticed a \nwallet just sitting there,\" Tim recounts. \nAccording to Tim, the wallet contained \nseveral large bills, two credit cards, and a \nfamily picture. The name on the credit cards \nwas William Bradlin, but there was nothing \nin the wallet that provided an address. \nWanting to return the wallet to \nMr. Bradlin as soon as possible, Tim walked \nto nearby Forest View Market to see if \nanyone could help him with his search. \n\"The first clerk I talked to immediately \nrecognized Mr: Bradlin's name,\" said Tim. \n\"He knew that Mr. Bradlin was the owner of \nThurmont Bicycles, just around the corner \nfrom the market.\" \nThe clerk made a quick phone call to \nMr. Bradlin, who rushed over to Forest View \nMarket. \n\"I must have lost my wallet walking \nfrom the market back to work,\" said \nMr. Bradlin, who was delighted with the \nreturn of his lost property. He was so pleased \nthat he opened up his wallet and bought all \n20 candy bars that Tim had for sale. And he \ngave him an extra $50 to further boost the \nuniform fund. \n\"A good deed like that deserves a \nreward!\" added Mr. Bradlin.",

Over the last 25 years, Norview City's population has grown \nfrom roughly 20,000 to nearly 50,000. This has put an enormous strain on our \nroads and bridges. The IRI will allow us to overhaul this network to meet the \nincreased demands. We also need a more robust and reliable communications \nsystem. To pay for these improvements, the city council has proposed increasing \nlocal taxes by 1 .3 percent. \nNoah Peavy: Critics argue that the funds needed to implement the IRI should be \ngenerated by budget cuts and the elimination of some government-sponsored \nprogrammes. How do you respond? \nMayor Swaraj: No other government in this city's history has done more to \ntrim the budget and eliminate ineffectual programmes than this one. However, \noveruse of this strategy might disrupt vital community services.],Past Shows,Schedule,Meet the Team\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nNorview City Observer \nTo the Edi tor: \nA poll conducted last week by the Centre for \nCivic Engagement has shown that only \n19 percent of respondents approve of the IRI. \nCritics of the IRI are most concerned that it \nwill be paid for by raising local taxes. This \nwill leave residents like me with less money \nfor food, clothing, and toiletries, which, in \nturn, will mean less revenue for businesses in \nthe area. It may also encourage high-income \nearners to leave Norview City or spend their \ndisposable income elsewhere. Any gains made \nby higher taxation would be offset by \ncorresponding losses. The city government \nshould look into other options to fund the \nproject. \nManami Ishida, Norview City \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHappy Days for Norview City \nCouncil \n(22 July)-This week brought some \nwelcome news for the Norview City \nCouncil. Just a few months ago, the \ncouncil's proposed Infrastructure \nRedevelopment Initiative seemed unlikely to \nsucceed; a poll released on 14 April by the \nCentre for Civic Engagement (CCE) \nrevealed that just 19 percent of respondents \nbacked the plan. Since then, the council has\nheld a series of public hearings, and a \nnumber of adjustments have been made to \nthe proposal. \nA CCE poll released earlier this week \nshows that now 52 percent of respondents \nare willing to fund the programme by paying \n0.5 percent more in taxes. Two more public \nhearings on the IRI have been scheduled. \nThe first will be held next Wednesday, \n27 July, at 7:00 PM. at the Norview City \nCommunity Centre.",
